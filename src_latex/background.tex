To study the impact of code smells on the fault-proneness of server-side JavaScript applications, {\color{blue} and to study the smells's survival}, we first need to identify a list of JavaScript bad practices as our set of code smells. Hence, we select 12 popular code smells from different JavaScript Style Guides~\cite{fard2013jsnose, npmjss, nodejss, airbnbjss, jqueryjss, ESLint}, {\color{blue} which are the same than those chosen in~\cite{saboury2017empirical}. Thereby, we will focus on the following code smells:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Lengthy Lines} appear when there are too many characters in a single line of code.
	\item \textbf{Chained Methods} appear when there is a ``chain'' of method calls (repeted chaining method). Chaining method is a common practice in object-oriented programming languages, that consists in using an object returned from one method invocation to make another method invocation.
	\item \textbf{Long Parameter List} happens when a function has too many parameters.
	\item \textbf{Nested Callbacks} are introduced in the code when multiple asynchronous tasks are invoked in sequence (\ie{} the result of a previous one is needed to execute the next one)~\cite{brodu2015toward, gallaba2015don}.
	\item \textbf{Variable Re-assign} corresponds to the reuse of variables in the same scope for different purposes.
	\item \textbf{Assignment in Conditional Statements} occurs when the \texttt{=} operator is used in conditions. For example: $if ( a = b )$
	\item \textbf{Complex Code} smell appears when a Javascript File is characterized by high cyclomatic complexity values (\ie{} high numbers of linearly independent paths through the code~\cite{mccabe1976complexity}).
	\item \textbf{Extra Bind} occurs most of time when we let ``\texttt{.bind(ctx)}'' on a function after removing a \texttt{this} variable from the body of the inner function, which is an unnecessary overhead.
	\item \textbf{This Assign} happens specifically when a \texttt{this} variable is stored in another variable to access to the parent scope's context.
	\item \textbf{Long Methods} is a well-known code smell \cite{marinescu2006object, fard2013jsnose, fontana2012automatic} which consists in writing a method with too many statements.
	\item \textbf{Complex Switch Case} happens when there are too many switch statements.
	\item \textbf{Depth} smell comes when the number of nested blocks of code (or the level of indentation) is too high.
\end{itemize}
